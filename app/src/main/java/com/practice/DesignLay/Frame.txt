Frame Layout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.
Generally, FrameLayout should be used to hold a single child view, because it can be
difficult to organize child views in a way that's scalable to different screen sizes
without the children overlapping each other.

You can, however, add multiple children to a FrameLayout and control their position
within the FrameLayout by assigning gravity to each child, using the
android:layout_gravity attribute.
